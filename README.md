# Tip-Calculator-Challenge

John and his family are on vacation and are going to 3 different restaurants. The bills are $124, $48 and $268.

To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator(as a function). He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is 
less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.

In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:

    Containing all three tips(one for each bill)
    Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).

(Note: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it with 20/100 = 0.2)
